This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by msafa.

Project DEscription:
NetPractice is a hands-on networking project featuring 10 progressive levels that teach essential computer networking fundamentals. Through interactive problem-solving, you'll master TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, default gateways, routing, and OSI layers by troubleshooting and configuring non-functioning network diagrams. This browser-based training provides practical experience in network administration, preparing you for real-world system administration and networking challenges.

Instructions
To use the training interface, download and extract the provided .tar archive. Inside, you will find an index.html file that serves as the main entry point for all 10 levels. You can open this file directly in your browser to start practicing. You may log in using your intranet login or leave the field empty to access last 5 levels randomly , which is the mode used during evaluations.
You can also open any specific level directly by selecting it from the directory.

For the final submission, you must include all 10 exported configuration files (one for each level) placed at the root of your repository, along with your README.md file.

Networking Concepts Covered

This project covers the following networking fundamentals:

IPv4 addressing

Subnetting and CIDR notation

Subnet masks

Network and broadcast addresses

Default gateways

Routing and routing logic, including static routing

Switches vs. routers

Network reachability and host communication

Use of AI

AI assistance was used only to clarify networking concepts and provide examples for terms such as subnetting, CIDR, routing, and network reachability. No configurations, solutions, or network setups were generated by AI. All level solutions and exported files were completed manually.
The subnetting logic—based on CIDR to efficiently divide an address space into the required number of hosts and subnets—was learned from the ITDose22 videos.

The project focuses on configuring IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and static routes to make networks function correctly. These tasks are part of the TCP/IP stack, which is a set of protocols that enables data communication over a network. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable delivery of data, while IP (Internet Protocol) handles addressing and routing. By mastering subnetting and network configuration in this project, you ensure that data can travel correctly between hosts, which is the foundation for TCP/IP communication.
