## Description
**NetPractice** is a hands-on networking project featuring 10 progressive levels that teach essential computer networking fundamentals. Through interactive problem-solving, you'll master:

- TCP/IP addressing  
- Subnet masks  
- Default gateways  
- Routing and routing logic  
- OSI layers  

Users troubleshoot and configure non-functioning network diagrams in a browser-based interface, providing practical experience in network administration. The project prepares participants for real-world system administration and networking challenges.

## Instructions

### 1. Setup
- Download and extract the provided `.tar` archive.  
- Open `index.html` in your browser to start practicing all 10 levels.

### 2. Training Mode
- Log in with your intranet credentials, or leave the field empty to access the last 5 levels randomly (used during evaluations).  
- You can also open specific levels directly from the directory.

### 3. Submission
- Export **all 10 configuration files** (one per level).  
- Place these files **at the root of your repository**, along with `README.md`.

## Resources

### References
- YouTube channel **ITDose22**: tutorials on subnetting, CIDR, and networking fundamentals.

### Networking Concepts Studied
- IPv4 addressing  
- Subnetting and CIDR notation  
- Subnet masks  
- Network and broadcast addresses  
- Default gateways  
- Routing, including static routing  
- Switches vs. routers  
- Network reachability and host communication  

### Use of AI
- AI was used **only for clarifying networking concepts and providing examples** (e.g., subnetting, CIDR, routing).  
- **No configuration files, solutions, or network setups** were generated by AI. All exercises were completed manually.

## Technical Definitions and Life Examples

### IP (Internet Protocol)
- **Definition:** Responsible for addressing and routing data packets across networks.  
- **Example:** IP is like a **full home address on a package**, showing where it should go.

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Definition:** Ensures reliable data delivery by checking errors, ordering packets, and retransmitting lost data.  
- **Example:** TCP is like a **responsible delivery service** that ensures the package arrives correctly.

### Network IP
- **Definition:** Identifies the network a device belongs to.  
- **Example:** Like a **neighborhood name** in a city address.

### Subnet Mask
- **Definition:** Separates the network part from the host part of an IP address.  
- **Example:** Tells delivery workers **which part is the neighborhood and which is the house number**.

### Default Gateway
- **Definition:** Router that forwards traffic to other networks outside the local network.  
- **Example:** The **main gate** of a neighborhood.

### Broadcast Address
- **Definition:** Special address to send data to **all devices in a network**.  
- **Example:** Loudspeaker announcement in a neighborhood.

## Addressing, Routers, Switches, and Hosts

### Addressing
- **Definition:** Unique identification of devices so data reaches the correct destination.

### Router
- **Definition:** Connects different networks and forwards packets based on IP addresses.  
- ![Router](router.png)  
- **Example:** Reception desk deciding which road a document/package should take to leave the building.

### Switch
- **Definition:** Connects devices within a local network and forwards data based on MAC addresses.  
- ![Switch](switch.png)  
- **Example:** Office floor manager delivering documents between desks on the same floor.

### Host
- **Definition:** Any device with an IP address capable of sending or receiving data.  
- ![Host](host.png)  
- **Example:** Employee at a desk creating or receiving documents.

---

## Routing Table

- **Definition:** Table stored in a router listing destination networks, next hop, and interface for forwarding packets.  
- **Example:** Directory/map at reception to decide which exit a package should take.

## IP Classes (CIDR and Usable Hosts)

| Class | CIDR | Subnet Mask | Host Bits (n) | Usable Hosts (2ⁿ − 2) |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| A     | /8   | 255.0.0.0   | 24            | 16,777,214           |
| B     | /16  | 255.255.0.0 | 16            | 65,534               |
| C     | /24  | 255.255.255.0 | 8           | 254                  |

- **Formula for usable hosts:** `2^n − 2` (n = host bits)

---

## Subnetting

- **Definition:** Dividing a network into smaller subnets by **borrowing bits** from the host portion.  
- **Number of subnets:** `2^x`, where x = borrowed bits  
- **Block size:** `256 − subnet mask value in the subnetted octet`  

| Borrowed Bits | Binary Mask | Decimal |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| 1             | 10000000   | 128    |
| 2             | 11000000   | 192    |
| 3             | 11100000   | 224    |
| 4             | 11110000   | 240    |
| 5             | 11111000   | 248    |
| 6             | 11111100   | 252    |

### Example: Class C /24 Network
```plaintext
Original Network: 192.168.1.0/24
Borrow 2 bits → /26 subnet mask
Number of subnets: 2^2 = 4
Remaining host bits: 6 → usable hosts per subnet: 2^6 - 2 = 62

Subnets:
Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0   - 192.168.1.63
Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64  - 192.168.1.127
Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.191
Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192 - 192.168.1.255
